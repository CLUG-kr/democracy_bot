synopsis: Extra concurrency primitives
description: The @concurrent-extra@ package offers among other things the
             following selection of synchronisation primitives:
             .
             * @Broadcast@: Wake multiple threads by broadcasting a value.
             .
             * @Event@: Wake multiple threads by signalling an event.
             .
             * @Lock@: Enforce exclusive access to a resource. Also known as a
             binary semaphore or mutex. The package additionally provides an
             alternative that works in the @STM@ monad.
             .
             * @RLock@: A lock which can be acquired multiple times by the same
             thread. Also known as a reentrant mutex.
             .
             * @ReadWriteLock@: Multiple-reader, single-writer locks. Used to
             protect shared resources which may be concurrently read, but only
             sequentially written.
             .
             * @ReadWriteVar@: Concurrent read, sequential write variables.
             .
             Please consult the API documentation of the individual modules for
             more detailed information.
             .
             This package was inspired by the concurrency libraries of Java and
             Python.
